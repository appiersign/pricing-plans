# Chippa
![preview](./chippa.png)

Chippa is a Single Page App built with [Vue Js](https://vuejs.org). It mimics an API call to display available subscription plans, and displays a payment form if any of the plan is clicked.
If further mimics an attempt to process the payment request and displays success message if all goes well.

This design was inspired by [Pricing](https://dribbble.com/shots/5380513-Pricing) by [Veronika Lkv](https://dribbble.com/v_inmotion).
